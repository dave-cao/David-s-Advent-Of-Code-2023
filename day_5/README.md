## Advent of Code Day 5

### Holy Shit

This was not my greatest solve. Part 1 was easy enough but Part 2 was crazy. At first I thought I had to parse through 80gb of data, but then I realized that it would be a lot faster if I transformed ranges instead and it worked! Sort of, for some reason, I got a bug where 0's would output as the smallest number for one of them. But...If I removed the zero, then I got the right answer. I'm not sure what the bug is but I spent the whole night last night working on this so I am done for day 5.
